# Games

Notes: * All python games was delevoped by using the 2.0.0.dev6 version of pygame module. i'm not sure if they will run fine in others versions;
	   * The purspose is create every single game in both platforms, but i'm heaving some troubles with Java perfomance in my PC, because of that the Java games is uploaded after
	   * I'm seriously thinking about start to develop also using the web platform (JS, HTML and CSS). Maybe then there's something like that around here.
